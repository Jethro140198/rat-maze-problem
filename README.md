# rat-maze-problem

In this project, I tried to use backtracking to solve the rat maze problem.

I have obtained the problem from geeksforgeeks. 

The rules are as follows:
1) The rat is allowed to only move DOWN and RIGHT
2) The rat will start from the ma[0][0] and end at ma[3][3]

Reference: Youtube - Computerphile - Sudoku with backtracking

Please feel free to take a look at my code and comment on the areas where I can improve on :-)
